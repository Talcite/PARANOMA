# PARANOMA
Regarding the fact that in the SCP fandom there are few interactive games else than some multiplayer FPS games (e.g. SCP: Secret Laboratory) and AVGs (from the classic SCP: Containment Breach to the more recent ones, like SCP: Blackout)... I decided to learn game design from the basics and make a pixelated single-player RPG, with features like choices-matter and multiple endings like Undertale.

Then I will probably post it onto the SCP Wiki as a tale.
